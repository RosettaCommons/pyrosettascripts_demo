       "The GeneralizedKIC mover allows a user to define a chain of atoms whose conformation is to be sampled or altered subject to the constraint that it remain closed, or that it be closed if it starts out open.  The mover has myriad options for controlling sampling and selection of a solution, and can invoke other movers to apply to each closed solution that it finds.  It has been written to be fully general, and can operate on chains of atoms that pass through backbones, side-chains, ligands, etc.  No assumptions about alpha-amino acid backbones are hard-coded, so GeneralizedKIC should be fully compatible with any non-canonical entity.\n",

       "\n",
       "\tlow_memory_mode (bool):  The low_memory_mode option can be used to limit the amount of information about each solution found that is stored, in order to reduce memory consumption. In this mode, only loop degree-of-freedom values are stored prior to selection. The drawback, however, is it can be risk to use low-memory mode with a preselection mover. Any changes to the pose made by the preselection mover will not be stored, so the preselection mover will have to be re-applied to the selected pose after selection. This costs additional time. In addition, if the preselection mover has any stochastic component to its behaviour, then the second application may not produce identical results to the first. This means that what might have been the lowest-energy pose when the preselection mover was first applied could now be a relatively high-energy pose, for example. For this reason, be judicious in the use of low-memory mode. The preferred course is to stop GenKIC when N solutions have been found to limit memory usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tcorrect_polymer_dependent_atoms (bool):  If set to true, atoms whose positions are dependent on polymer bonds, such as amino acid \"H\" and \"O\" atoms, will have their positions set to ideal coordinates after closure.  False by default.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tdont_fail_if_no_solution_found (bool):  By default, the GeneralizedKIC mover returns failure status if it fails to find a closed solution that passes filters.  Certain usage cases require that it does not fail.  If this option is set to true, it prevents GeneralizedKIC from returning a failure status, even if it finds no solution (in which case the input pose, which may have an open chain of atoms, is returned as the output pose).  This is necessary, for example, when GeneralizedKIC is used in conjunction with a ContingentFilter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tselector (genkic_selector_name):  The GeneralizedKICselector to use to pick a solution.  Solutions may be picked randomly (\"random_selector\"), by energy (\"lowest_energy_selector\"), or by other criteria.  See the Rosetta help wiki for more information on GeneralizedKICselectors, and for the full range of options.\n",

       "\tstop_if_no_solution (int,\"0\"):  If this option is used and set to a positive integer N, GeneralizedKIC stops looking for closure solutions if no solution was found in the first N attempts.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tclosure_attempts (int):  The maximum number of times to try to find a solution.  Set this to zero to keep trying indefinitely (in which case the \"stop_when_n_solutions_found\" option should be used to prevent the mover from iterating forever).\n",
       "\n",
       "\tstop_when_n_solutions_found (int):  If this option is used and set to a positive integer N, GeneralizedKIC will stop looking for closure solutions as soon as at least N solutions have been found that pass filters.  Note that a GeneralizedKICselector must be specified even if this option is set to 1, because a single attempt can yield up to 16 solutions.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tpre_selection_mover (string):  As an optional alternative to restricting oneself to backbone-only score terms, GeneralizedKIC permits the user to specify a pre-selection mover defined prior to the GeneralizedKIC block. This permits side-chain moves, such as repacking or side-chain minimization, prior to scoring with the full energy function. Note that this mover will be applied to all candidate solutions passing filters, which makes this option potentially very computationally expensive!\n",
       "If a pre-selection mover is specified, the mover may alter geometry outside of the loop to be closed, or may alter the FoldTree, in which case these alterations will carry through to the final pose returned by GeneralizedKIC. TaskOperations and MoveMaps may be used appropriately in the definition of the mover in question to restrict its effects to the loop on which GeneralizedKIC is operating if the user does not wish to alter geometry outside of this loop. If one wishes to apply more than one pre-selection mover (for example, a PackRotamersMover followed by a sidechain-only MinMover, to repack and minimize side-chains), they may be combined in a ParsedProtocol mover.\n",
       "As a final note, a mover may return failure status, or may encapsulate filters that return failure status, in which case the solution to which the mover has been applied will be discarded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\tcontingent_filter (string):  A ContingentFilter can also be used to record whether the mover failed. The ContingentFilter is a specialized filter that has its value set by a mover. GeneralizedKIC can set the value of a ContingentFilter, specified using the contingent_filter flag, to true or false depending on whether the closure was successful or unsuccessful. Subsequent application of the filter, possibly at a later point, can then abort trajectories involving unsuccessful loop closure.  Note that this is a largely deprecated feature that has been retained since a few users have found it useful in some cases; for most usage cases, one can simply rely on the fact that the mover returns failure status if no closed solution is found.  It will likely be necessary to use the \"dont_fail_if_no_solution_found\" option if a ContingentFilter is used.\n",

Users can optionally specify a list of \"tail\" residues that are covalently attached to, and move with, the chain of residues to be closed.  For example, one might have a series of glycans attached to a serine residue in a protein loop that's being closed with GenKIC.  If these residues are specified as tail residues, then they will remain attached to the serine residue even as the loop that contains the serine residue moves.\n",
